# Peerly

_The peer tutoring platform_

## Getting Started

If `docker` is available, simply build and run the `Dockerfile`. The website will be exposed on inner port `8000`.\
Otherwise, use the npm package `serve`. Run `npx serve ./dist -l 8080 -s`, which will expose the website on port `8080`.

## Credits

This project uses [`React`](https://react.dev/), [`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com/), [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [`Framer Motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion) for the frontend.\
[`Faker.js`](https://fakerjs.dev/) is used to generate fake data for the tables.
